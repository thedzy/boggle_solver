    -C PATTERN [PATTERN ...], --contains PATTERN [PATTERN ...]
            Filter results containing the patterns in any order
            Example:
            te a s can find: teas and steady but not seats
            Default: None

Keyboard emulations:
    Emulate key presses in Windows

    -e [WAIT_TIME], --enter [WAIT_TIME]
            After x seconds delay, start entering with keyboard
            This is the time to switch to the app to receive keyboard strokes
            WARNING: It is highly recommended that you leave your console window accessible
            Default: 4
            Note: Windows ONLY
    -S SPEED, --speed SPEED
            Set the keyboard speed from -1 to 50 when using -e/--enter
            Note: -1 will be interpreted as random between each action.
            Note: Some programs have issues with a very high speeds
            Default: 47
    -i, --interrupt-off
            Do not exit when returning to the window where the code ran from when using -e/--enter
            Default: False

## Why?
Just about every time I am playing Microsoft WordamentÂ® (boggle knockoff) I can't help but think that it would be an easy thing to code.  Originally, I imagined it similar to a maze solver and convinced that it could be done with little effort.

Sometimes you just need to know your ideas work for sure.

Only way to know for sure, was to do it.  So I did it.  Here it is.

## Improvements?
While sorting the dictionary made huge improvements in speed, ~~it is still a little slow when it gets into long words, big puzzles, or some combination of the two.~~

While I debated multithreading it, just to see the change, I ultimately decided that beyond just proving it could be done.  Solving all the starting points simultaneously would have an ~~huge~~ impact.

## State?
No known bugs.  Works.

## New
### 1.1
- I have made performance improvements by orders of magnitude.  From a 5x5 puzzle and finding words up to 9 in length taking minutes to 100x100 and 32 in length taking seconds.\
- Now uses a custom dictionary format, converter included.  Dictionary is now a hierarchy of letters, allowing fast searches for partial words.

### 1.2
- Added regex filtering to results

### 1.3
- Replaced the dictionary to better align with Wordament, old one still remains
- Made column mode the default with the ability to override
- Listing alphabetically is optional now, otherwise, will display in the order found
- Added option to list is ascending or descending size
- Added option to send key presses on Windows to enter the words into Wordament
- Fixed an issue in convert_dicitonary.py that caused it to require additional words
- If all letters are single, spaces are not required.  ex: `-p a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p`  =>  `-p abcdefghijklmnop`

### 1.4
- Made the keyboard entry speed settable as well as variable
- Put in checks that keyboard entry only runs on Windows
- By default if you return to where you started the code it will stop, instead of typing into the console window (optional off)
- Changed parameter 'x' to 'M' after seeing Windows respects case
- Added option `-C` to filter words that contain patterns or characters, simpler for those that don't know REGEX
    - Can still use REGEX in addition to the above filter
    
### 1.4.1
- Cleaned up the help to make it more readable
